JSClosureExperiment
===================

This is a project where I was experimenting with closures in Javascript.

I decided to play with client side scripting in JS, but utilizing closures to enforce 
data encapsulation in an attempt to design de-coupled OO code.

This project is the beginnings of a front-end windowing framework for a web based
chat system.

The next step in this project would be to add ajax calls to send messages to
server side scripts to propogate chat messages to other users in the system, and to
add said server side functionality.
